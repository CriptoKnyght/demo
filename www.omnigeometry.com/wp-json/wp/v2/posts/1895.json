See this video where our lead developer Sakari shows how this feature works:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/339412900\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>Using FFmpeg to create movie out of your image sequence<\/h3>\n<p>You can use the free and open source software <a href=\"https:\/\/ffmpeg.org\/\">FFmpeg<\/a> to encode your images into movie format. Here is one way to encode your exported images into a 60 FPS h264 movie file:<\/p>\n<pre>ffmpeg -framerate 60 -pattern_type glob -i '*.png' -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4<\/pre>\n<p>In this case, I have created a separate directory to which I have moved all the PNG files exported from OmniGeometry, and I run this command inside this directory. This will create a movie called <em>out.mp4<\/em> from all the PNG files in that directory. The <em>-crf 20<\/em> option controls the constant rate factor, which is one parameter affecting the quality of the movie, the lower the better.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend testing out different options and to use higher bitrates than for normal videos, as these sacred geometry patterns are very information dense, and are not compressed as well as traditional videos of people and so on. You can also add the &#8216;-preset veryslow&#8217; to the command to use the best quality available.<\/p>\n<p>Below is an example movie exported using ffmpeg:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/339413990\" width=\"640\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this new feature!
