The intent behind this group is to:<\/p>\n<p>1) Allow you to share your art in a higher resolution format.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately the sharing options on Instagram greatly diminished the resolution of the original artwork. Through Telegram you&#8217;ll be able to share uncompressed files so that we can share your work on our social media platforms and give you exposure (of course you always have the full rights to your art \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>2) Allow users to share ideas and collaborate with each other.<\/p>\n<p>If you see other OmniGeometry users doing things with the software that inspire you then simply ask them how they achieved that specific effect or look. Or if you see an artist with a style that would complement your own and you would like to collaborate then simply message them and get to work.<\/p>\n<p>To join please access the members area and under announcements you&#8217;ll find the link to join!<\/p>\n<p>Best regards,<\/p>\n<p>OmniGeometry Team<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OmniGeometry just got a whole lot better!
