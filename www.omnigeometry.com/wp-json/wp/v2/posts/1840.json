Line weights are now by default adjusted based on the recursion level, producing more beautiful patterns by default.<\/p>\n<h3>One way scaling &amp; scale fading<\/h3>\n<p>The animation scaling now has two modes: sinusoidal (back and forth) and saw wave (one way). Scaling can now also be combined with the fading in and out effect, allowing the layers to be faded in or out as they are reaching the end of the scale phases. This can create some very beautiful tunnel like effects when combined with the saw wave scaling mode especially.<\/p>\n<h3>Projection mode<\/h3>\n<p>Projection mode makes it easy to enter into fullscreen mode with no UI elements visible, making ideal for VJing or just admiring your scene without any distractions. Pressing ctrl+alt+U will toggle the projection mode in fullscreen. Pressing ctrl+U (toggle UI) in projection mode will gradually return back towards full UI visibility.<\/p>\n<h3>Line weight modes<\/h3>\n<p>Line weight now has three distinct modes, which affect how the line weights are adjusted over levels of layer recursion.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>&#8220;Recursive&#8221;<\/em> means that the layers line weights are adjusted based on the recursion level.<\/li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Animation scaled recursive&#8221;<\/em> adjusts the line weights based on the current animation scaling value.<\/li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Fixed&#8221;<\/em> always keeps the line weight at it&#8217;s set value, keeping line weight static between recursion levels.<\/li>\n<li>The <em>&#8220;Animation scaled recursive&#8221;<\/em> is same as in version 1.2, providing backwards compatibility with existing scenes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Tracing store<\/h3>\n<p>You can now store the current tracing into the tracing store with comma (,). This acts like another background layer, where the contents of the tracing are copied and the current tracing cleared. This way you can easily find a good looking trace and continue building on top of that easier. The stored tracing can be cleared with (alt+,).<\/p>\n<h3>Improved fill layer functionality<\/h3>\n<p>The filling of layers now fills the whole layer consistently, instead of filling separate parts of the layers and resulting in overdraw. This actually makes the fill functionality usable with recursion.<\/p>\n<h3>Layer selection with mouse &amp; selection rectangle<\/h3>\n<p>Layers can now be selected by clicking on them in the canvas. Shift + clicking selects\/deselects multiple layers.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also added a new mouse mode, the layer selection mode, where you can select multiple layers from the secene with a traditional selection rectangle.<\/p>\n<h3>Changes on how modify all works<\/h3>\n<p>Pressing space bar now toggles Select All layers. Previously it toggled modify all.<\/p>\n<p>Select all will only keep selected those layers you originally had in the scene when toggling it, and not select new layers when copying. This behaves like modify all before, selecting and unselecting all layers when toggled.<\/p>\n<p>Modify all is now toggled with shift+space, and will always modify all of the layers, not taking into account copying of layers.<\/p>\n<p>You can also now invert the current layer selection with shift+control, making it easier to switch modifying between two sets of layers for example.<\/p>\n<h3>Removed features &amp; backwards compatibility notes<\/h3>\n<p>This version brings also some possibly scene breaking fixes and feature removals.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>vertical and horizontal ratio parameters have been removed<\/strong> as they didn&#8217;t really bring much benefit in the philosophical sense of what OmniGeometry is doing. We might be looking in the future how to achieve the same effect from another angle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We also evaluated the MIDI support to not to be so usable state yet, so for now it has been removed<\/strong>. We are thinking about implementing this in a more proper way in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The previous version also had a bug in the way star and curve values were calculated with recursion, that has been fixed and will affect existing scenes using star and curves with recursion, so you might have to adjust existing scenes to find the same visual representation.<\/p>\n<h2>Complete list of changes<\/h2>\n<h4><strong>New features<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Undo\/Redo support. Still slightly experimental, but fully usable in most cases.<\/li>\n<li>One way scaling support to create amazing, hypnotizing zooming and tunneling animations, good to use with trace as well.<\/li>\n<li>Smooth fade-in &#8211; fade-out to scaling animation, to create soothing zooming and tunneling animations.<\/li>\n<li>Projection mode for working with scenes without any user interface. All controls are still available via keyboard shortcuts and mouse. Great for doing VJ work live or simply being fully immersed in the space.<\/li>\n<li>Storing of tracing into tracing store.<\/li>\n<li>Selecting of layers by clicking on the layers on the canvas.<\/li>\n<li>Layer selection rectangle, allowing easy selection of multiple layers<strong>.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Usability improvements<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major performance improvements in drawing, resulting in smoother and faster operation.<\/li>\n<li>Now it&#8217;s possible to drag an OmniGeometry scene file directly on the canvas to load.<\/li>\n<li>Modify all moved to shift+space, (un)select all layers is now in space.<\/li>\n<li>Invert layer selection is now at shift+ctrl.<\/li>\n<li>Active layer and selected layers information is now saved to scene and will come up when loading.<\/li>\n<li>Canvas size now only accepts positive values over 32.<\/li>\n<li>Keyboard shortcuts Q and W now change child radius value linearly, allowing more precise control of child radius values, and calculates the child radius ratio based on the child radius.
