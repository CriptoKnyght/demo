Notice how many different intersections of basic pythagorean triangles you can see in the first image also, all this by simple triangles interfering with each others. This is information and math in visual form.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Now, with OmniGeometry, you can easily look at this pattern from another dimension, seen in the next image with the 6 points. And upping the points coming closer to a circle, you see what kind of information this number formation represents at higher levels of accuracy.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">With OmniGeometry you can learn, see and feel math in visual form.

The same rules of fractality and division of cells according to the Golden Ratio can be found in all the patterns that Nature produces.<\/p>\n<p>With OmniGeometry you have the power to express these forms from many different angles instantly, rapidly iterating through sacred geometry patterns, in the process finding those patterns that somehow speak to you and that mean something to you. This finding of meaning in the patterns can help you to connect the dots in your thinking also, and ultimately even lead to having alltogether new ways to think about everything you do.<\/p>\n<p>In that process you can also start to understand how and why natural patterns interweave in everything we do and ultimately create.<\/p><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">The seemingly simple rules define the most basic building blocks of our physical reality, and then from iteration and applied ratios and rules, lifeforms are created.\u00a0 OmniGeometry is a way of expressing these patterns with great power, a highly developed one that helps you and let&#8217;s you focus on what&#8217;s important when exploring these creation patterns.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1762\" src=\"https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824-1024x925.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"925\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824-1024x925.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824-300x271.png 300w, https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824-768x694.png 768w, https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824-1536x1387.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824-595xh.png 595w, https:\/\/www.omnigeometry.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/IMG_20190103_161510_824.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here you can see how a certain configuration of triangles clearly form the Golden Ratio (Phi ~1.618) rectangle within their interference patterns.
